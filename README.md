So... If anyone is reading this right now well I should explain things I guess:

The summary is â€“ end of last year and begining of this year I had a really rough time mentally, I am doing ok now But I thought it best to take a break from the internet for a while,
And do a bit of a fresh start in the meantime so, most of the things that used to be here wont be soon.

I'll come back properly in a while but until then... farewell and good luck
