So what exactly can one expect to find here?
To be honest probably not much for a small while; I[^1] am still on the uphill (one must imagine sisyphus a foxgirl) from some rather rough mental health stuff I'd rather not elaborate on towards the end of 2024, basically -> gotta rest the paws to prevent further burnout.

Though the gears of industry and intelect still turn thus I continue to work (for self?) my main projects at the moment are:

   - Reading list of the things I can't track on bookwyrm and notes if needed (e.g. textbooks, disserations, etc) \
   - Several Esays of which I hope only one will be thesis length (Why is it always the eepy ones who have ideas?) including but not limited to  
        1. Thesis on effects of chronic non-traumatic stress inherent in societies treatment of Neurodivergent people (focusing on 'late diagnosed' youths and young adults with
           l1 ASD) from an own voices perspective
        2. Essay (I claim this one will not become a thesis but... we shall see) on contemporary internet erotic literature as a commentary on the medical industry (main focus on               HDG)
        3. Mycelial network: design an examination of Hyphanet (Formerly freenet) and potential extensions thereof (I don't if this one will get finished)      
   - My Nix dotfiles for when I eventually move from Arch (btw)

Current research interests can be found in bio!

[^1]: I have previously gone by raven (not plural [possibly dpdr though], just indescisive). A little extra tidbit for those interested in etomology, the name Xenia comes from Xenos meaning both stranger & hospitality (though not the origional interpretation as far as I know I use it to signify masking and how being hospitible made me feel like a stranger to myself [here she goes oversharing again]), and Tulikettu from the finnish fire-fox mythology (less deep of a reason for chosing, i just find the idea interesting and cute)
