# Welcome weary travellers

## Who/What am I?
____________________________
A very silly fox-girl (sometimes kit) and this is my personal/indie research profile so any fun stuff I do for myself including essays which arent affiliated with any '_proper_' research org (whatever that is). Currently I am not working with any institution (you can pet unemployed canids totally!), and am still taking things slow-ish as I get back from some pretty intense burnout (late 2024). I do not and will not work in making generative AI, partially ethics partially I find it boring in comparison to other compsci subjects.

## What am I interested in?
_______________________________
My exact interests vary widely from time to time (such is the hyperfixation->burnout cycle) but mainly and most of the time I am interested in:
   - Psychology (currently intrested a lot in potential masking => dissacoiative disorders connection[^1])
   - Philosophy (currently focused on extension of hauntology as redescribed in the _ghosts of the future_ section of _capitalism and nothingness_[^2] to lost potential _selves_ as opposed to society)
   - Theoretical Computer Science  mainly out their weird internet or storage stuff ** especially if its old ** (gopher, hyphanet [formerly freenet], etc)
   - Mathematics (not much are of focus currently)
   - Werid literature both comforting and horrifying

## Most Used languages![^3]

## What am I actually working on
_______________________

   - Reading list of the things I can't track on bookwyrm and notes if needed (e.g. textbooks, disserations, etc) \
   - Several Esays of which I hope only one will be thesis length (Why is it always the eepy ones who have ideas?) including but not limited to  
        1. Thesis on effects of chronic non-traumatic stress inherent in societies treatment of Neurodivergent people (focusing on 'late diagnosed' youths and young adults with l1 ASD and issues with the public understanding of the term 'low support needs') from an own voices perspective
        2. Essay (I claim this one will not become a thesis but... we shall see) on contemporary internet erotic literature as a commentary on the medical industry (main focus on HDG)
        3. A little look at indie/alt internet technologies (gopher, gemini, hyphanet [formerly freenet], i2p, etc) might end up as blog posts instead of published papers if I can keep things in scope for once    
   - My Nix dotfiles for when I eventually move from Arch (btw)
## Things I will likely never do but kinda want to;
- Rewrite Shell/Cargo-mommy in raw Assembly (As ASM-mummy bc I am an evil aussie)
